🥗 Kale Caesar Quinoa Salad Recipe – CSS Styling Project
Welcome! This is a simple front-end project focused on HTML and CSS styling for a recipe page. The goal of this project is to demonstrate my ability to structure semantic HTML and apply clean, readable CSS styling to a basic webpage layout.

🔍 Project Overview
This webpage presents a Kale Caesar Quinoa Salad with Roasted Chicken recipe, complete with:

A featured image

Title and description

Total cook time

Ingredients list

Step-by-step preparation instructions

A citation with an external recipe link

All the elements are structured using semantic HTML tags and styled with a separate CSS stylesheet.

🎯 Objectives
The main goals of this project were to:

Practice writing semantic HTML for clarity and accessibility

Use CSS selectors to style elements based on class, tag, and ID
